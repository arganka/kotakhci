> This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps: ([Keshav 2007:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPA6VZMX?page=1))

The first pass, five-ten minutes to:  
1. Read title, abstract, and introduction  
2. Read section, subsections, and other headings (ignore everything else)  
3. Read conclusions  
4. Glance over the reference (mentally ticking off what weâ€™ve read)  
  
At the end, use 5Cs to evaluate the paper:  
1. Category (what type of paper? empirical/case-study/etc)  
2. Context (other related papers, grounded theory/concept)  
3. Correctness (valid assumptions?)  
4. Contributions (main contributions)  
5. Clarity (well-written/not) ([note on p.1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPA6VZMX?page=1))
