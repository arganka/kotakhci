> The second pass should take up to an hour. After this pass, you should be able to grasp the content of the paper. You should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else. This level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you are interested, but does not lie in your research speciality. ([Keshav 2007:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPA6VZMX?page=2))

Second pass, with a greater care, may took an hour to:  
1\. Look at the figures/diagram/other illustrations in the paper. See whether this is an excellent work  
2\. Mark relevant unread references for further reading  
  
We should be able to explain the paper to someone else. Three options to move forward:  
1\. Set aside the paper (bye!)  
2\. Revisit later  
3\. Push through to the 3rd pass ([note on p.2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPA6VZMX?page=2))
