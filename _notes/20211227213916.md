> Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey. This will require you to read tens of papers, perhaps in an unfamiliar eld. What papers should you read? Here is how you can use the three-pass approach to help ([Keshav 2007:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPA6VZMX?page=2))

#### What papers should I read?  We can use the three passes for a literature survey.  
1. Find 3-5 recent paper with well-chosen keywords in Scholar/CiteSeer/SemanticScholar. Do 1st pass for all of them.
2. On the related works see for survey paper (if found, read it)
3. If no survey paper found, find a shared citations and repeated authors name in the references. Download the key papers and set them aside. Find the top conferences by visiting the authors website.
4. Go to the website for these top conferences, look through their recent proceedings. Find the high-quality work.
