> You should identify and challenge every assumption in every statement. Moreover, you should think about how you yourself would present a particular idea. This comparison of the actual with the virtual lends a sharp insight into the proof and presentation techniques in the paper and you can very likely add this to your repertoire of tools. During this pass, you should also jot down ideas for future work. ([Keshav 2007:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPA6VZMX?page=2))

The third pass, may take four-five hours for beginners to:  
* virtually reimplement the paper  
* identify and challenge every assumption in every statement  
* jot own ideas for future work  
  
At the end of this pass we should be able to:  
* reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory  
* find implicit assumption, missing citations to important work, and flaws in analysis or experiment
